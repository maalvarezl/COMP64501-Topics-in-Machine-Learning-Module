    "Performing a solve instead of a matrix inverse is the more numerically stable approach, but we can do even better. A [QR-decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) of a matrix factorises it into a matrix which is an orthogonal matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$, so that $\\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{I}$. And a matrix which is upper triangular, $\\mathbf{R}$. \n",

    "This is a more numerically stable solution because it removes the need to compute $\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\mathbf{X}$ as an intermediate. Computing $\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\mathbf{X}$ is a bad idea because it involves squaring all the elements of $\\mathbf{X}$ and thereby potentially reducing the numerical precision with which we can represent the solution. Operating on $\\mathbf{X}$ directly preserves the numerical precision of the model.\n",

    "This can be more particularly seen when we begin to work with *basis functions* in the next week. Some systems that can be resolved with the QR decomposition can not be resolved by using solve directly."

    "We've now seen how we may perform linear regression. Now, we are going to consider how we can perform *non-linear* regression. However, before we get into the details of how to do that we first need to consider in what ways the regression can be non-linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariate linear regression allows us to build models that take many features into account when making our prediction. In this session we are going to introduce *basis functions*. The term seems complicated, but they are actually based on rather a simple idea. If we are doing a multivariate linear regression, we get extra features that *might* help us predict our required response variable (or target value), $y$. But what if we only have one input value? We can actually artificially generate more input values with basis functions.\n",

    "### Non-linear in the Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "When we refer to non-linear regression, we are normally referring to whether the regression is non-linear in the input space, or non-linear in the *covariates*. The covariates are the observations that move with the target (or *response*) variable. In our notation we have been using $\\mathbf{x}_i$ to represent a vector of the covariates associated with the $i$th observation. The coresponding response variable is $y_i$. If a model is non-linear in the inputs, it means that there is a non-linear function between the inputs and the response variable. Linear functions are functions that only involve multiplication and addition, in other words they can be represented through *linear algebra*. Linear regression involves assuming that a function takes the form\n",
